     * Pixel format. Notes:
     *
     * RGB32 is handled in an endian-specific manner. A RGBA
     * color is put together as:
     *  (A << 24) | (R << 16) | (G << 8) | B
     * This is stored as BGRA on little endian CPU architectures and ARGB on
     * big endian CPUs.
     *
     * When the pixel format is palettized RGB (PAL8), the palettized
     * image data is stored in AVFrame.data[0]. The palette is transported in
     * AVFrame.data[1] and, is 1024 bytes long (256 4-byte entries) and is
     * formatted the same as in RGB32 described above (i.e., it is
     * also endian-specific). Note also that the individual RGB palette
     * components stored in AVFrame.data[1] should be in the range 0..255.
     * This is important as many custom PAL8 video codecs that were designed
     * to run on the IBM VGA graphics adapter use 6-bit palette components.
